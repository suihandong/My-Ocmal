Liverpool did not fluff their lines a third time. They returned to the
top of the league with a slick and stylish victory that showcased the
attacking talent they have at their disposal and made a useful dent in
the goal-difference advantage Manchester City hold. City can regain
the lead by beating Chelsea on Sunday, but Liverpool will then have a
game in hand, a rest until the Champions League resumes with the visit
of Bayern Munich, and the knowledge they can still overwhelm opponents
when the need arises.

Bournemouth may not present the toughest of challenges away from home,
but after the points recently dropped most Liverpool fans would have
greeted any sort of win with relief. The results are all that really
count at this stage of the title race, and Liverpool know if they keep
winning there is nothing City can do, though this was a comfortable
and controlled performance that could have produced a more emphatic
scoreline and suggested plenty left in reserve. Just about the only
disappointment for Jurgen Klopp and his players was a succession of
missed chances at the end. With a little more composure in front of
goal Liverpool could practically have wiped out the goal-difference
deficit, and what a statement of intent that would have been.

The first goal came midway through the first half and changed the mood
of the afternoon completely. In the 23 minutes that preceded it,
Liverpool had shown diligence and patience but not much imagination in
trying to break down Bournemouth’s low defensive block. The visitors
found they could cope with build-up play that varied between
predictable and clumsy, and when Mohamed Salah found pockets of space
on the right his attempts on goal did not cause Artur Boruc undue
concern.

The breakthrough, when it came, was simplicity itself, although Eddie
Howe was probably right in claiming it was fractionally offside. A
James Milner corner failed to beat the first defender, but when Naby
Keïta calmly returned the ball to the right for the jobbing full-back
to have another go he swung over a much better cross that Sadio Mane
met with a firm downward header. It was his fourth goal in four games,
and Mane showed his versatility a couple of minutes later by launching
Liverpool’s next attack from close to the corner flag in his own
half. A clever ball down the left channel found Roberto Firmino
running into free space, and when the Brazilian looked up he was able
to pick out Georginio Wijnaldum up in support. The midfielder should
probably have gone for goal himself from a threatening position,
though he appeared to lack confidence and moved the ball wider to
Salah, who miscontrolled.

Wijnaldum did not make the same mistake when his next chance arrived
10 minutes later, courtesy of an inspired ball forward from Andy
Robertson. Again in an unusually advanced position, Wijnaldum first
showed neat control to reach the pass, then with the ball still
bouncing spotted his opportunity to lift a shot over Boruc, who had
advanced slightly from his line.

Bournemouth had stayed mostly compact after going a goal down but were
obliged to come out a little with their deficit doubled. Before
retiring to defensive duties the visitors had almost taken an early
lead when Ryan Fraser tested Alisson in the second minute, but the
goalkeeper beat away the shot. Salah brought a save from Boruc at the
end of the first half as Liverpool tried to extend their lead, and
Jefferson Lerma fired over the bar just before the interval with his
side attempting to get back into the game.

Within three minutes of the restart Bournemouth’s hopes of a comeback
were quashed when Liverpool pushed further ahead in exquisite
style. Salah scored it, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner
with his usual efficiency, though the sublime touches came from Keita,
with a superbly weighted ball forward into Firmino’s path, and Firmino
himself, who dummied to shoot before casually backheeling the ball
into space where he knew Salah would be waiting. It was the Egyptian’s
20th goal of the campaign in all competitions, making him the first
Liverpool player since Luis Suarez to achieve the feat in successive
seasons.

Salah hit the bar with only Boruc to beat as the game moved into its
final quarter. The result was never in doubt, but when Keita, Firmino
and Trent Alexander-Arnold joined him in missing gilt-edged
opportunities from close range in the closing minutes it meant
Bournemouth were allowed to get off relatively lightly. A little more
ruthlessness would not go amiss if this is to be Liverpool’s year.
