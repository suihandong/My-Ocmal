A
file
with
only
words
separated
by
newline
characters
There
are
no
punctuation
and
no
new
line
characters
It
is
thus
difficult
to
read
but
makes
splitting
a
list
of
characters
into
a
list
of
strings
easy
One
just
uses
the
split
on
char
function
in
the
String
module
The
name
of
that
function
has
three
parts
separated
by
underscore
characters
But
this
file
only
has
letters
and
newline
characters
and
no
punctuation
so
we
cannot
use
the
actual
name
Hopefully
that
is
not
too
confusing
A
more
sophisticated
mechanism
is
need
to
split
the
input
into
a
list
of
word
for
the
article
about
Liverpool
since
it
has
new
line
characters
and
punctuation
symbols
